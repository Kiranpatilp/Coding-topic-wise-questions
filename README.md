Sliding window:

Listing down 11 sliding window based problems which all follow same kind of approach with minor tweaks:
	• https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-continuous-subarray-with-absolute-diff-less-than-or-equal-to-limit/
	• https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-substrings-containing-all-three-characters/
	• https://leetcode.com/problems/replace-the-substring-for-balanced-string/

	• https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/
	• https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/
	
Basic template of such problems is basically 3 steps.
Step1: Have a counter or hash-map to count specific array input and keep on increasing the window toward right using outer loop.
Step2: Have a while loop inside to reduce the window side by sliding toward right. Movement will be based on constraints of problem. Go through few examples below
Step3: Store the current maximum window size or minimum window size or number of windows based on problem requirement.
